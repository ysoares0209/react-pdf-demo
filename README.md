## Result
This is a fail.
The goal here was to test 3 things:

1. That I would be able to dynamically alter the PDF content, which I could using states & passing it to the PDF
2. Check how the page break would work
3. Validate if I could perform actions when a click happen inside the PDF - that one is a failure

In general the tool is not really meant to do what I'm trying to achieve.
The final goal is to reproduce a behaviour from jotform, but react-pdf is not the way to go
